## Introduction

Angel Trading Co. is a project that seeks to provide collectors with a place to trade and find others who are also interested in trading. We want to give collectors, enthusiasts, and new hobbyists alike a centralized place where they can find other local collectors to trade with. Currently, we are focusing on supporting Smiski communities!

## Application Architecture

The application is divided into a frontend and a backend. We are Postres as our database and Django as our backend framework with Python. The frontend is built with React, Vite, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS. For authentication we are using Clerk. Alongside Postgres we use AWS S3 with AWS Cloudfront for our media storage. Additionally we use the GPT-4 Vision API for image recognition and classification.
