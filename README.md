## Introduction

Angel Trading Co. is a project that seeks to provide collectors with a place to trade and find others who are also interested in trading. We want to give collectors, enthusiasts, and new hobbyists alike a centralized place where they can find other local collectors to trade with. Currently, we are focusing on supporting Smiski communities!
