## Introduction

Angel Trading Co. is a project that seeks to streamline the buying, selling, and trading experience of collectors within the Smiski community. Due to the absence of a dedicated communication hub, we aspire to provide avid collectors, trade enthusiasts, and newcomers a platform where they can immerse themselves in a culture of like-minded individuals. Currently, we are focused on supporting Smiski communities but are looking to broaden our service to other collectibles!

## Application Architecture

Our application is divided into two main components: frontend and backend. For the frontend, we are currently using React, Vite, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS. For the backend, we are using the Django framework with Python. Additionally, we are using Postgres SQL as our database and AWS S3 with AWS Cloudfront for media storage. We are also using Clerk for user authentication and GPT-4 Vision API for image recognition and classification.
